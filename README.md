**Project synopsis.** In this project, we consider a set of photographs and a set of scans of Monet paintings. We are interested in developing a deep learning model that can learn to translate photos into images in the style of Monet paintings.

Repository contents:

* monet-cyclegan.ipynb - a Jupyter notebook with our EDA, preprocessing, model building, hyperparameter tuning, and discussion
* 16_1.png, 16_2.png, 64_1.png, and 64_2.png - images showing examples of original photos and Monet-style translations generated by our model
* leaderboard.png - an image showing our model's performance in a Kaggle competition
* GAN_output_1.jpg and GAN_output_2.jpg - images generated by a less successful Monet generating model based on a simple GAN
* PNGs with images depicting hyperparameter tuning and training performance
